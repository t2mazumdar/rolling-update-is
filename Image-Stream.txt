**OpenShift ImageStream** 
Deploys container images across environments.

**Create a New Project**
oc new-project imagestream-lab

**Create an ImageStream**
oc create imagestream myapp

**Import an External Image**
oc import-image myapp --from=nginx:latest --confirm

This pulls the image into OpenShiftâ€™s internal registry and tags it as `latest`.

**Deploy Using ImageStream**
oc new-app myapp

Inspect the image and create a Deployment and Service automatically.
**Trigger a Build with ImageStream**
Create a `BuildConfig` that uses the ImageStream:

**Monitor ImageStream**
oc describe is myapp

Check tags, image history, and automatic updates.


##Promote Image Across Environments##

**Create three projects:
oc new-project app-dev
oc new-project app-staging
oc new-project app-prod


**Import image into `app-dev`:
oc project app-dev
oc import-image myapp --from=nginx:latest --confirm

oc app-staging

Tag image to staging and prod:
oc tag app-dev/myapp:latest app-staging/myapp:latest
oc tag app-staging/myapp:latest app-prod/myapp:latest
